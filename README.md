 # Description of our game “Snake”:
 # A snake will appear at a random location in the game area. Users control the movement of snake by inputting “w”, “s”, “a” and “d”, with each representing upwards, downwards, left and right. Users can choose either “classic mode” or “challenge mode” at the beginning of the game. In “classic mode”, only food will appear randomly; in “challenge mode”, both food and bombs will appear randomly, and users need to control the snake to avoid bombs as well as eating food. When the snake eats food, it grows longer and gains scores. When the score accumulates to certain levels, congratulations will pop up. The snake cannot touch the walls, bombs, and its own body or tail, otherwise the snake will be killed game ends.
 # Our system records the highest score of the user. When the record is broken, the user will be congratulated.
 # Users can pause the game and exit any time, and the game status will be kept. Users can continue their last attempt next time. However, when the snake is dead, the game status will be cleared.
 # We may have other versions where users can decide the size of the game area.
